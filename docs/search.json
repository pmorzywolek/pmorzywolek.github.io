In my research project, I apply methods from causal inference to infer the optimal time to initiate treatment in critically ill patients using observational routinely collected data.\nI graduated with a mathematics degree from ETH Zurich with a focus on statistical learning theory and financial mathematics. Previously, I worked as a teaching assistant at African Institute for Mathematical Sciences in South Africa and as an actuary and a data scientist in a consulting company EY in Switzerland and Spain."
