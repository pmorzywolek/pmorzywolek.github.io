In my research project, I apply methods from causal inference to infer the optimal time to initiate treatment in critically ill patients using observational routinely collected data.\nI graduated with a mathematics degree from ETH Zurich with a focus on statistical learning theory and mathematical finance. Previously, I worked as a teaching assistant at African Institute for Mathematical Sciences (AIMS South Africa) and as an actuary and a data scientist in a consulting company EY.\n\n\n\nResearch interests\n\nCausal inference\nSemiparametric theory\nStatistical machine learning\nApplications in medicine\n\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\nMSc in Mathematics, 2015  ETH Zurich\n\n\nBSc in Mathematics, 2014  ETH Zurich"
