    "text": "Biography\nI am a postdoc in the Department of Statistics at the University of Washington working with Alex Luedtke. My research focuses on causal inference and statistical inference for infinite-dimensional parameters, with application to study the efficacy of infectious disease prevention strategies. I am also currently UW Data Science Postdoctoral Fellow and PIMS-Simons Postdoctoral Fellow.\nI obtained my PhD in Statistical Data Analysis from Ghent University under supervision of Johan Steen, Wim Van Biesen and Stijn Vansteelandt. In my PhD project, I applied methods from causal inference to infer the optimal time to initiate treatment in critically ill patients using observational routinely collected data.\nPreviously, I graduated with a Mathematics degree from ETH Zurich with a focus on statistical learning theory and mathematical finance. I also worked as a teaching assistant at the African Institute for Mathematical Sciences (AIMS South Africa) and as an actuary and a data scientist in a consulting company EY.\n\n\n\nResearch interests\n\nCausal inference\nSemiparametric theory\nStatistical machine learning\nApplications in medicine\n\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\nPhD in Statistical Data Analysis, 2023  Ghent University\n\n\nMSc in Mathematics, 2015  ETH Zurich\n\n\nBSc in Mathematics, 2014  ETH Zurich"
