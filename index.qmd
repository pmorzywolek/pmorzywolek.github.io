# Biography

I am a PhD student in statistical data analysis at [Ghent University](https://www.ugent.be/en). In my research project, I apply methods from causal inference to infer the optimal time to initiate treatment in critically ill patients using observational routinely collected data.

I graduated with a mathematics degree from [ETH Zurich](https://ethz.ch/en.html) with a focus on statistical learning theory and mathematical finance. Previously, I worked as a teaching assistant at African Institute for Mathematical Sciences ([AIMS South Africa](https://aims.ac.za/)) and as an actuary and a data scientist in a consulting company [EY](https://www.ey.com/en_ch).
