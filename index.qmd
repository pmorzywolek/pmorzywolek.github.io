# Biography

I am a PhD student in statistical data analysis at Ghent University. In my research project, I apply methods from causal inference to infer the optimal time to initiate treatment in critically ill patients using observational routinely collected data.

I graduated with a mathematics degree from ETH Zurich with a focus on statistical learning theory and financial mathematics. Previously, I worked as a teaching assistant at African Institute for Mathematical Sciences in South Africa and as an actuary and a data scientist in a consulting company EY in Switzerland and Spain.
